0.8385326290679668 Since the VPS provided by the uni is not exposed to the Internet, how do we obtain SSL certificates for https from Let's Encrypt? It is not possible to use certbot (or similar) because the VPS needs to be reachable from the public Internet for the challenge. <-> Hi,
Just wanted to check something as I'm not sure either way. I've now got a CI pipeline fully setup, and in last week's masterclass it was at least implied that once we'd done that we should be able to go to our ip address at port 8080 and we would get a basic JHipster page back. However, I'm still getting a timeout message when I attempt to do this, and further I'd assume this would need some boilerplate code in the repository that I can't find. For the sake of clarification, should we be able to get something back from the ip address once the CI pipeline is setup or not?

So what should we really be including in it?
