Dear Sir, I have questions about the first individual submission. For kanban feature cards and personas, each member with the group should submit their own individualized version for them right?  So totally 7 personas and 7 kanban feature cards right?   And for mockup of functionality, you still need 7 different individualized versions of mockups yet under the same app development topic right? Thank you!
